# Interaction-Design

This is the improved version of the RainyDays website. The following improvements has been made:

- Added form handling to the contact form with a feedback to the user when the form is submitted.
- Added a functioning shopping cart with a "Remove item from cart"-button. The shipping/payment form also has to be filled to place the order successfully.
- Divided the "Expiry date" field in shipping/payment form into a "Epiry year" and "Expiry month" field so that the user no longer has to manually add a "/"-separator between year and month.
- Added "products in cart" counter throughout the website.
- Added dropdown select-box for size selection on product pages.
